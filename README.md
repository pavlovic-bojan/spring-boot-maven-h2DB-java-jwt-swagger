# Blogging REST API App (spring-boot-maven-h2DB-java-jwt-swagger)

This repository is the result of my independent project to train certain things in Spring Boot & REST API Backend Development.

The goal of the project is to clone the basic backend functionality of the most popular web app for blogging [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) for the purpose of learning back-end REST API development.

Side information: To use the application in a special environment the author accepts no responsibility if you cause damage to third parties.
